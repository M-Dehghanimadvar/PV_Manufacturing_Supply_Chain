# PV-Manufacturing-Supply-Chain
PV manufacturing supply chain model can be used to optimize the cost of PV manufacturing supply chain including, investment, operational, trade and logistic costs. The model will assess the minimum sustainable price (MSP) of local PV manufacturing.  

# Requirements
Python package dependent
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - numpy_financial
  - pyomo

# Dataset
The excel file is provided as a data source for input data. All required data can be updated according to the considered technology. For instance, required data for 60 cells mono-crystalline PERC is upload as dataset.csv. For any uncertain data, a uniform distribution is used. For example, the EVA purchasing cost from Malaysia as one of the suppliers is considered between a higher range of 1.5 to a lower range of 1.3 USD/m2.
